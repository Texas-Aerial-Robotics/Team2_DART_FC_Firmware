TEAM 2 DART FIRMWARE DEVELOPMENT

Authors: Abhirit Das, Ben Park, Lucas Sanabria, Samuel Tamayo

Progress:
1) Operate an LED (10.27.2024)
2) Able to sample IMU data using SPI and transmit data through UART (11.16.2024)

Current Goals:
1) Apply filters for stable angle and altitude values
2) Design a high-level control system model
3) Implement PID control in firmware
4) Evaluate ways to test firmware on a physical DART prototype
